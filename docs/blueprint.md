## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Neon Blue (#00FFFF) to capture a futuristic, tech-oriented feel. Chosen to represent technology while not being as ubiquitous as other color options. This vibrant hue is suitable for a dark color scheme.
- Background color: Dark navy (#0A192F), offering a high-contrast backdrop that accentuates the neon elements. Chosen because its hue aligns with the primary color.
- Accent color: Electric Indigo (#6F00FF), an analogous hue with higher saturation, providing vibrant highlights and interactive element glow effects. This contrasts well against the neon blue, to ensure the theme remains consistent yet interesting.
- Font choice: 'Orbitron' (sans-serif) for main titles and headings, providing a futuristic and tech-inspired appearance; 'Montserrat' (sans-serif) for body text, ensuring readability and a clean interface. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Implement a full-screen hero section layout with blurred media imagery, creating an immersive experience.
- Incorporate smooth scroll transitions and glow on hover effects to enhance user engagement and interaction.
- Utilize simple, glowing line icons related to media and technology to complement the dark theme.
